Crypt::Blowfish_PP
==================

Blowfish is a published algorithm written by Bruce Schneier
(http://www.counterpane.com/). Unlike IDEA or DES etc. there are no patent
implications in using this algorithm.

It uses anywhere between a 64 bit and a 144 bit key. The transform itself is
fast and operates on a 64 bit block, and most of the calculation time is in
initialising the context with the key data.

The _PP name comes from the fact that this implementation is Pure Perl, and
will not have any compatibility problems.

I have not included any sort of multiblock structure in this implementation
(I might do in future), so to be useful you will probably need something
like Crypt::CBC. (v1.01 fixes the compatibility issues with Crypt::CBC)

To install, untar the module

do the standard:
$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ make test
# make install

This implementation is entirely object oriented, and entirely written in Perl.
The perl form is (c) copyright Matthew Byng-Maddick <matthew@codix.net> 2000,
and the actual structure and static data are copyright Bruce Schneier.

The licensing is GPL or Artistic at your preference, as with Perl itself.
